# AgTools Research Impact Statement

*Advancing Sustainable Agriculture Through Technology*

---

## Mission Alignment

AgTools directly supports USDA strategic priorities for American agriculture:

1. **Climate-Smart Agriculture** - Carbon tracking, sequestration documentation
2. **Precision Agriculture Adoption** - Data-driven decision support
3. **Sustainable Intensification** - Produce more with fewer inputs
4. **Rural Economic Development** - Technology access for all farm sizes

---

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

American farmers face mounting pressures:
