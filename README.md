## 🌾 Overview

**AgTools** is a professional-grade crop consulting platform designed with 30 years of field experience and modern AI technology. This system provides data-driven pest/disease identification, intelligent spray recommendations, economic threshold analysis, **input cost optimization**, and complete decision support for corn and soybean production.

**Version 2.1** adds **Real-Time Pricing Integration** and **Weather-Smart Spray Timing** - use your actual supplier quotes for accurate ROI calculations, and optimize spray timing with weather-based decision support.

**This is not a hobby project** - it's a professional tool that provides genuine consulting value.

- **Economic Models** showing ROI for every recommendation
- **Resistance Management** built into all recommendations
- **Professional Knowledge** equivalent to extension bulletins

### Example ROI

**Scenario:** Soybean aphid at threshold in 160-acre field

1. System identifies pest → Soybean Aphid (95% confidence)
2. Threshold check → TREAT (300/plant vs 250 threshold)
3. Recommendation → Warrior II 2.56 oz/acre
4. Economics:
   - Protected yield: 4 bu/acre × 160 acres = 640 bu
   - Revenue protected: 640 bu × $12 = $7,680
   - Total cost: $2,800
   - **Net benefit: $4,880**
   - **ROI: 174%**

Your consulting fee is fully justified!
